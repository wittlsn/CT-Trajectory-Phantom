# CT-Trajectory-Phantom
Script for generating a test phantom for CT trajectory optimisation. The object can be 3d printed in different materials to validate the CT optimisation algorithm with both simulated and real data.

# Experiment Scenes
Experiments for papers. Use: [artist-api](https://github.com/wittlsn/aRTist-PythonLib/tree/artist_thd_wip) to generate the data. The ``generate_hexagon_sphere.py`` must be executed before the experiments scripts!
